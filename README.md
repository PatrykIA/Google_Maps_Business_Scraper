Google Maps Business Scraper

Project Description

This project is an advanced scraper designed to search and extract business data from Google Maps, integrated with Google Sheets using the Apify platform and Make. The scraper allows for automatic retrieval of information about businesses that meet specific search criteria, which the user can define directly within a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Features

- Full Integration with Google Sheets: The scraper is fully integrated with Google Sheets, allowing it to be controlled directly from the spreadsheet. Users can input search criteria (e.g., business category, location) into specific cells and run the scraper by clicking a button in the sheet.
- Flexible Search Criteria: Users can add additional criteria, such as service type, operating hours, or specific business features, enabling more precise searches.
- Automatic Scraper Execution: The scraper is triggered from Google Sheets via a custom button created using Google Scripts.
- Detailed Filtering of Results: The scraper allows for detailed filtering, enabling the search for specific types of businesses in a given region.
- Data Export: Search results, including business name, category, address, website, phone number, Google Maps URL, ad status, rating, price, and scrape date, are automatically saved to the Google Sheets spreadsheet.
